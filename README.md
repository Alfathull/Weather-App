# Weather App

This is a sophisticated weather application built with Laravel and Tailwind CSS, designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information by interfacing with the OpenWeatherMap API. The application is responsive, ensuring optimal display on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
- **5-Day Weather Forecast**: Displays a comprehensive 5-day weather forecast that updates dynamically based on data retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Interactive Weather Maps**: Integrates Leaflet.js for interactive mapping, showing different weather layers such as precipitation, clouds, and temperature, pulled from OpenWeatherMap's tiled weather maps.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring the application is fully responsive and functional across all devices and screen sizes.

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration

- **Current and Forecast Weather Data**: Makes HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoints to retrieve current weather data and a 5-day forecast. This data is then parsed and displayed in various components of the application.
- **Weather Map Layers**: Uses OpenWeatherMap's layered maps to display real-time weather phenomena by overlaying data on an interactive Leaflet.js map.

### Frontend Design

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, taking advantage of its utility-first classes to create a modular and easily maintainable stylesheet.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Implements flexible grid and flex layouts to ensure the application is accessible and usable on a wide range of devices.
